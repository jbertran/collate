# Collate

Really simple, really stupid way to use a dict to describe filters on a file tree,
because I'm too lazy to write out the whole input set when I need to concatenate a
PDF with `pdftk`.

## Dependencies

* Python3.4+

## Install

There's a `collate` package on pip, so install in a dedicated virtual environment
just in case.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/jbertran/collate.git
```

## Usage

```collate --help```
